# CS364A: Algorithmic Game Theory
Solutions to Tim Roughgarden's [Algorithmic Game Theory](http://timroughgarden.org/f13/f13.html) course exercises and problems.

While I do make the solutions public, I actually strongly recommend to attempt some of these problems on your own.

If you notice any mistakes/typos in my solutions, feel free to contact me or open an issue.
Also, if you have some inspiration, take a look at https://github.com/lekhovitsky/CS364A/issues/2 for the list of stuff I didn't manage to solve yet &mdash; let's collaborate.

Note: the solutions are written in Markdown + MathJax, but some modifications were needed in order to make it look fine on GitHub (see https://github.com/lekhovitsky/CS364A/issues/5) which may make it break when rendered with other tools (even those using MathJax).
