My solutions to Tim Roughgarden's Algorithmic Game Theory course exercises and problems.

GitHub doesn't render formulas in `.md` files, so one might use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app) to view the solutions online (just copy-paste the code there) and  [Markdown Viewer](https://github.com/simov/markdown-viewer) or [Typora](https://typora.io/) to view them locally (yeah, not very useful, but still better than uploading `.tex` here).
