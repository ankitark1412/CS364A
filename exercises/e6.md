# Exercise Set VI

### Exercise 45

A multi-commodity flow is a tuple $f = (f_1, \dots, f_k)$ where every $f_i$ represents a single-commodity flow of $r_i$ units of traffic from $s_i$ to $t_i$. If $\mathcal P_i$ is a set of paths from $s_i$ to $t_i$, then $\sum_{P_i \in \mathcal P_i} f_i^{P_i} = r_i$, where $f_i^P$ is a fraction of flow $f_i$ that goes through path $P \in \mathcal P_i$.

A multi-commodity flow $f$ is called optimal if every single-commodity flow $f_i$ follows only the shortest paths, i.e. simultaneously for all $i$ holds
$$
P_i^* \in \underset{P_i \in \mathcal P_i}{\arg\min} \left\{ 
	\underbrace{\sum_{e \in P_i} c_e(f_e)}_{ := C_{P_i}(f)} 
\right\},
$$
where $f_e$ is the total amount of traffic from all flows that go through edge $e$, i.e.,
$$
f_e = \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{P_i \in \mathcal P_i\ :\ e \in P_i} f_i^{P_i}.
$$

### Exercise 46

Total travel time by path:
$$
C(f) = \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{P_i \in \mathcal P_i} f_{P_i} c_{P_i} (f).
$$
Total travel time by edge:
$$
C(f) = \sum_{e \in E} f_e c_e(f_e).
$$

### Exercise 47

The upper bound on the price of anarchy can be extended to the multi-commodity network setup by considering the network that consists of $k$ "replicas" of a Pigou network, each having source and target nodes $s_i, t_i$ and the same amount of flow $r$. 

### Exercise 48

We're solving the following problem:
$$
\alpha(\mathcal C) = 
	\sup_{c \in \mathcal C} \max_{r \ge 0} \max_{x \ge 0} 
		\frac{r \cdot c(r)}{x \cdot c(x) + (r - x) \cdot c(r)}.
$$
By $\sup_{c \in \mathcal C}$ we understand $\max_{a, b \ge 0}$. 

The inner-loop maximization is equivalent to minimization of $f(x) = x (ax + b) + (r - x) (ar + b)$ over $x \ge 0$. By taking the derivative and equating it to $0$, we get $x = \frac{r}{2}$. 

Next, we maximize a function $g(r) = \frac{r c(r)}{\frac{r}{2} c(r) + \frac{r}{2} c(r/2)}$ over $r \ge 0$. After all simplifications,
$$
g(r) = 1 + \frac{1}{3 + \frac{4b}{a} r},
$$
which is a decreasing function of $r$ that is maximized at $r = 0$, giving $g(0) = \frac{4}{3}$. Additional maximization step over $a$ and $b$ doesn't change anything, so we finally arrive to $\alpha(\mathcal C) = \frac{4}{3}$. 

### Exercise 49

Let $f^*$ be an optimal flow with $r$ units of traffic, and $f$ be an equilibrium with $r/2$ units, i.e.,
$$
\sum_{e \in E} f_e^* = r,\ \sum_{e \in E} f_e = \frac{r}{2}.
$$
 Then we have
$$
\sum_{e \in E} f_e^* c_e(f_e^*) 
	\ge \sum_{e \in E} f_e c_e(f_e)
	= \sum_{e \in E} 2 f_e \frac{1}{2} c_e \left( \frac{2 f_e}{2}\right) 
	= \sum_{e \in E} \tilde f_e \tilde c_e( \tilde f_e ),
$$
where $\tilde f_e = 2 f_e \Rightarrow \sum_{e \in E} \tilde f_e = 2 r / 2 = r$. So, we arrive to the conclusion that cost of the equilibrium flow $\tilde f$ with modified cost functions $\{\tilde c_e\}$ is at most the cost of the optimal flow with original cost functions $\{c_e\}$. 

Also, if $c_e(x) = \frac{1}{u_e - x}$, then $\tilde c_e(x) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{u_e - \frac{x}{2}} = \frac{1}{2u_e - x}$, which is equivalent to doubling the capacity of an edge.

### Exercise 50

To show that we only need to change $2$ to $1 + \delta$ in the original proof, as nothing else changes there. The inequality 
$$
f_e^* \left[ c_e(f_e) - c_e(f_e^*)\right] \le f_e c_e(f_e)
$$
 still holds, summing it up over all edges gives us 
$$
C(f^*) 
	\ge \underbrace{\sum_{e \in E} f_e^* c_e(f_e)}_{ \ge (1 + \delta) r L} 
	- \underbrace{\sum_{e \in E} f_e c_e(f_e)}_{ = rL}
	\ge \delta r L = \delta \cdot C(f),
$$
so finally $C(f) \le \frac{1}{\delta} C(f^*)$, which is what we wanted to show.

### Exercise 51

For this problem, let's consider a Pigou-like network with polynomial cost function $c(x) = x^d$. We'll try to vary the degree $d$ to show that the bound is tight. 

With $r$ units of traffic, the cost of the equilibrium flow is $C(\text{EQ}) = r \cdot c(r) = r^{d+1}$. 

With $(1+\delta r)$ units of traffic, the cost of the optimal flow is the solution to the following minimization problem:
$$
C(\text{OPT}) = \min_{x \ge 0} \left[ x \cdot c(x) + ((1+\delta) r - x) \cdot c(r) \right].
$$
 The derivative of this function for arbitrary $c$ is $c(x) + x \cdot c^\prime(x) - c(r)$, which in our case gives $x^d (d+1) - r^d$. Equating this to zero and solving w.r.t. gives us the optimal amount of traffic to be sent to the upper edge:
$$
x = \frac{r}{\sqrt[d]{d+1}},
$$
so now 
$$
C(\text{OPT})
	= r \cdot \frac{r^d}{d+1} + \left((1 + \delta) r - \frac{r}{\sqrt[d]{d+1}}\right) \cdot r^d
	= \underbrace{r^{d+1}}_{=C(\text{EQ})} \cdot \left[ \delta + \left(1 - \frac{d}{(d+1)^{1+\frac{1}{d}}} \right) \right].
$$
The expression $1 - \frac{d}{(d+1)^{1+1/d}}$ can be made arbitrarily  small by increasing $d$ sufficiently, so for given $\delta$ and $\epsilon$ it's just a problem of selection of $d$ so that
$$
C(\text{EQ}) \ge \left(\frac{1}{\delta} - \epsilon \right) \cdot C(\text{OPT}),
$$
which concludes the proof of tightness of the bound.

### Exercise 52



### Exercise 53

The inequality can be directly checked for pairs $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, $(1, 0)$, $(1, 1)$. 

We need to show that $5 y^2 + z^2 \ge 3 y + 3 z y$. Rewrite  left hand side as $(2y^2) + (3y^2 + z^2)$ and compare respective terms: 

* $2 y^2 \ge 3y$ for all integer $y > 1$, so we have the first part;
* $3 y^2 + z^2 \ge 2\sqrt{3} y z$ by the Cauchy inequality; $2 \sqrt{3} > 3$, so now we have the second part.

Adding two inequalities gives us the desired result.

### Exercise 54
