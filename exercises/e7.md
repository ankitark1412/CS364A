# Exercise Set VII

### Exercise 55

Total cost of the flow $f$ by edge:
$$
C(f) = \sum_{e \in E} f_e c_e(f_e).
$$
Potential function of the flow $f$:
$$
\Phi(f) = \sum_{e \in E} \sum_{i=1}^{f_e} c_e(i).
$$
Since edge cost functions are non-decreasing, $c_e(i) \le c_e(f_i)$ for $i \le f_i$, so for any edge $e$
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{f_e} c_e(i) \le \sum_{i=1}^{f_e} c_e(f_e) = f_e c_e(f_e) \underbrace{\Rightarrow}_{\text{sum over all edges}} \Phi(f) \le C(f).
$$
To prove the second part of the inequality, we need to exploit the fact that cost functions are affine. For a given edge $e$ with cost $c_e(x) = a_e x + b_e$, we have 
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{f_e} c_e(i) 
	= \sum_{i=1}^{f_e} (a_e i + b_e) 
	= a_e \left( \sum_{i=1}^{f_e} i \right) + b_e \left( \sum_{i=1}^{f_e} 1 \right)
	= a_e \frac{f_e (f_e + 1)}{2} + b_e f_e
	\ge \frac{1}{2} f_e (a_e f_e + b_e) 
	= \frac{1}{2} f_e c_e(f_e).
$$
Summing this inequality over all edges gives $\Phi(f) \ge \frac{1}{2} C(f)$.

### Exercise 56

The exercise asks to prove the theorem that in an atomic selfish routing games with weighted players and affine cost functions $c_e(x) = a_e x + b_e$, there always exists an equilibrium flow. 

Let every player $i \in \mathcal N$ control $r_i$ units of flow. The guessed candidate potential function is 
$$
\Phi(f) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{e \in E} \left(f_e c_e(f_e) + \sum_{i\ :\ e \in P_i} r_i c_e(r_i) \right).
$$
To prove the theorem, we need to show that $\Phi$ is indeed a potential function of the game. Let's fix an arbitrary flow $f$ and a player $i$ who considers deviating from the path $P_i$ to $P_i^\prime$. Let's call the flow where $i$ deviates to $P_i^\prime$ and all other agents follow the same paths as $f^\prime$. 

Now we need to verify that the difference of potential functions evaluated at $f^\prime$  and $f$ equals the difference in costs of $i$, i.e.
$$
\Phi(f^\prime) - \Phi(f)
    = \sum_{e \in P_i^\prime \setminus P_i} r_i c_e(f_e + r_i)
	- \sum_{e \in P_i \setminus P_i^\prime} r_i c_e(f_e).
$$
I'll denote by $\Phi_e(f)$ the component of the sum in the definition of $\Phi(f)$ that corresponds to the edge $e$.

For all edges that are both in $P_i$ and in $P_i^\prime$, $\Phi_e(f^\prime) - \Phi_e(f) = 0$. Same for all edges that are neither in $P_i$ nor $P_i^\prime$. 

For edges that are in $P_i^\prime \setminus P_i$ we have 
$$
\Phi_e(f^\prime) - \Phi_e(f) 
	= (f_e + r_i) c_e(f_e + r_i) + \sum_{j\ :\ e \in P_j} r_j c_e(r_j) + r_i c_e(r_i)
    - f_e c_e(f_e) - \sum_{j\ :\ e \in P_j} r_j c_e(r_j) 
    = 2 r_i c_e(f_e + r_i).
$$
Similarly, for all edges that are in $P_i \setminus P_i^\prime$, 
$$
\Phi_e(f^\prime) - \Phi_e(f) 
	= (f_e - r_i) c_e(f_e - r_i) + \sum_{j\ :\ e \in P_j} r_j c_e(r_j) - r_i c_e(r_i)
    - f_e c_e(f_e) - \sum_{j\ :\ e \in P_j} r_j c_e(r_j) 
    = 2 r_i c_e(f_e).
$$
(Painful arithmetics is hidden in both of the last deviations, left as an exercise for the reader :D Just substitute $c_e(x) = a_e x + b_e$ everywhere.)

Summing the differences over all edges and dividing by $2$ gives us the desired expression. Now, as we've proven that $\Phi$ is indeed a potential function of the game, we can use the same reasoning as before, i.e., number of strategies is finite, so global minimizer of $\Phi$ exists and corresponds to the equilibrium.

### Exercise 57

Mixed Nash Equilibrium $\sigma \in \Delta(\mathcal A)$ defined using pure strategies deviations:
$$
\forall i \in \mathcal N,\
\forall a_i^\prime \in \mathcal A_i,\ 
\sum_{a \in \mathcal A} \sigma(a) c_i(a) 
\le 
\sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma_{-i}(a_{-i}) c_i(a_i^\prime, a_{-i}). 
\tag{1}
$$
Mixed Nash Equilibrium $\sigma \in \Delta(\mathcal A)$ defined using mixed strategies deviations:
$$
\forall i \in \mathcal N,\ 
\forall \sigma_i^\prime \in \Delta(\mathcal A_i), \
\sum_{a \in \mathcal A} \sigma(a) c_i(a) 
\le 
\sum_{a_i^\prime \in \mathcal A_i} \sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma_i(a_i^\prime) \sigma_{-i}(a_{-i}) c_i(a_i^\prime, a_{-i}). 
\tag{2}
$$
Let's show that these two are equivalent.

1. mixed => pure

    Selecting $\sigma_i^\prime$'s from vertexes of a simplex $\Delta(\mathcal A_i)$ immediately renders the inequality (2) into (1).

2. pure => mixed

    Fix arbitrary distribution $\sigma_i^\prime \in \Delta(\mathcal A_i)$. Multiplying both sides of (1) by $\sigma_i^\prime(a_i^\prime)$ and summing over all $a_i^\prime$ gives

$$
\sum_{a \in \mathcal A} \sigma(a) c_i(a) \underbrace{\sum_{a_i^\prime \in \mathcal A_i} \sigma_i^\prime(a_i^\prime)}_{=1}
\le 
\sum_{a_i^\prime \in \mathcal A_i} \sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma_i(a_i^\prime) \sigma_{-i}(a_{-i}) c_i(a_i^\prime, a_{-i}),
$$

â€‹		which is exactly (2).

### Exercise 58

Let $\sigma = \sigma_1 \times \dots \times \sigma_n$, $\sigma_i \in \Delta(\mathcal A_i)$. 

Mixed Nash Equilibrium:
$$
\forall i \in \mathcal N,\
\forall a_i^\prime \in \mathcal A_i,\ 
\sum_{a \in \mathcal A} \sigma(a) c_i(a) 
\le 
\sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma_{-i}(a_{-i}) c_i(a_i^\prime, a_{-i}). 
\tag{1}
$$
Correlated Equilibrium:
$$
\forall i \in \mathcal N,\ 
\forall a_i \in \mathcal A_i,\ 
\forall a_i^\prime \in \mathcal A_i,\ 
\sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma(a_i, a_{-i}) c_i(a_i, a_{-i}) 
\le
\sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma(a_i, a_{-i}) c_i(a_i^\prime, a_{-i}).
\tag{2}
$$

Observe that $\sigma(a_i, a_{-i}) = \sigma_i(a_i) \sigma_{-i}(a_{-i})$.

1. MNE => CE

    First, we make an important observation that for a given player $i$, all actions $a_i \in \mathcal A_i$ that are in support of $\sigma_i$ (i.e., $\sigma_i(a_i) > 0$) must have the same expected cost $C = \sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma_{-i}(a_{-i}) c_i(a_i, a_{-i})$. Otherwise, $i$ would be better off by removing actions with higher cost, meaning $\sigma$ is not an equilibrium. This also means that the expected cost of the mixed strategy $\sigma_i$ itself $\sum_{a \in \mathcal A} \sigma(a) c_i(a)$ also equals $C$.

    Now, since expected cost of a mixed strategy equals expected costs of action in its support, from (1) we can deduce 
    $$
    \forall i \in \mathcal N,\
    \forall a_i \in \mathcal A_i : \sigma_i(a_i) > 0,\ 
    \forall a_i^\prime \in \mathcal A_i,\ 
    \sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma_{-i}(a_{-i}) c_i(a_i, a_{-i}) 
    \le 
    \sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma_{-i}(a_{-i}) c_i(a_i^\prime, a_{-i}). 
    \tag{3}
    $$
    
    Multiplying both sides of (3) by $\sigma_i(a_i)$ gives us the inequality from (2). For actions that are not in the support of $\sigma_i$, it holds trivially. 

2. CE => MNE

    Simply  summing both sides of (2) over all $a_i \in \mathcal A_i$ gives

    $$
    \forall i \in \mathcal N,\ 
    \forall a_i^\prime \in \mathcal A_i,\ 
    \sum_{a \in \mathcal A} \sigma(a) c_i(a) 
    \le
    \sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma_{-i}(a_{-i}) c_i(a_i^\prime, a_{-i}) \underbrace{\sum_{a_i \in \mathcal A_i} \sigma_i(a_i)}_{=1},
    $$
which is exactly (1).

### Exercise 59

Original definition of CE:
$$
\forall i \in \mathcal N,\ 
\forall a_i \in \mathcal A_i,\ 
\forall a_i^\prime \in \mathcal A_i,\ 
\sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma(a_i, a_{-i}) c_i(a_i, a_{-i}) 
\le
\sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma(a_i, a_{-i}) c_i(a_i^\prime, a_{-i}).
\tag{1}
$$
Definition of CE using switching functions (some revelation principle vibes here):
$$
\forall i \in \mathcal N,\ 
\forall \delta: \mathcal A_i \to \mathcal A_i,\ 
\sum_{a \in \mathcal A} \sigma(a) c_i(a) 
\le
\sum_{a \in \mathcal A} \sigma(a) c_i(\delta(a_i), a_{-i}).
\tag{2}
$$

1. (1) => (2)

    Fix player $i$ and arbitrary $\delta$. For every action $a_i \in \mathcal A_i$, let $a_i^\prime = \delta(a_i)$. Then, from (1) we have 
    $$
    \forall a_i \in \mathcal A_i,\ 
    \sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma(a_i, a_{-i}) c_i(a_i, a_{-i}) 
    \le
    \sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma(a_i, a_{-i}) c_i(\delta(a_i), a_{-i}).
    $$
    Summing it over all possible actions $a_i$ gives us the inequality from (2). 

2. Not (1) => not (2)

    Let's assume that $\sigma$ is not a CE, i.e. there exists a player $i$ that has a reasonable deviation from $a_i$ to $a_i^\prime$, i.e. 
    $$
    \sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma(a_i, a_{-i}) c_i(a_i, a_{-i}) 
    \ge
    \sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma(a_i, a_{-i}) c_i(a_i^\prime, a_{-i}).
    $$
    Let's than introduce a switching function $\delta$ such that $\delta(a_i) = a_i^\prime$, and for all other actions of a player $i$ it just returns its input. But then
    $$
    \sum_{a \in \mathcal A} \sigma(a) c_i(\delta(\hat a_i), a_{-i}) 
    	= \sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma(a_i, a_{-i}) c_i(a_i^\prime, a_{-i})
    	+ \sum_{\hat a_i \in \mathcal A_i} \sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma(\hat a_i, a_{-i}) c_i(\hat a_i, a_{-i})
    	\le \sum_{a \in \mathcal A} \sigma(a) c_i(a),
    $$
    i.e. (2) doesn't hold.

In the first step we've shown, that the set of distributions that satisfy (1) is a subset of the set of those that satisfy (2). In the second step we've then shown that there exist no distributions that satisfy (2) but don't satisfy (1). So we can conclude that definitions (1) and (2) are equivalent.

### Exercise 60

A strategy profile $\sigma \in \Delta(\mathcal A)$ is a correlated equilibrium when:
$$
\underbrace{\forall i \in \mathcal N,}_{\text{every player}}\ 
\underbrace{\forall a_i \in \mathcal A_i,}_{\text{every suggested action}}\ 
\underbrace{\forall a_i^\prime \in \mathcal A_i,}_{\text{every conditional deviation}}\  \\
\sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma(a_i, a_{-i}) c_i(a_i, a_{-i}) 
\le
\sum_{a_{-i} \in \mathcal A_{-i}} \sigma(a_i, a_{-i}) c_i(a_i^\prime, a_{-i}).
$$
(In fact, for semantic correctness, $\sigma(a_{-i} \mid a_i)$ must used on both sides of the inequality above, but technically these are equivalent inequalities.)

Summing both sides of each group of inequalities over $a_i$ gives
$$
\underbrace{\forall i \in \mathcal N,}_{\text{every player}}\ 
\underbrace{\forall a_i^\prime \in \mathcal A_i,}_{\text{every unconditional deviation}}\  \\
\sum_{a \in \mathcal A} \sigma(a_i, a_{-i}) c_i(a_i, a_{-i}) 
\le 
\sum_{a \in \mathcal A} \sigma(a_i, a_{-i}) c_i(a_i^\prime, a_{-i}),
$$
which is precisely the condition that $\sigma$ is course correlated equilibrium. So, every CE is automatically CCE.

### Exercise 61

For a given agent, the suggested distribution results in a 50% chance of being a single agent on the edge and a 50% chance of being one of two agents on the edge, so the expected cost of the flow is $\frac{3}{2}$. For any pure strategy deviation, these chances are exactly the same, so is the expected cost. Thus, the distribution is indeed CCE. 

To show that the distribution is not CE, we simply need to observe that once a player receives a signal to follow an edge, it can deviate to any edge with a number of different evenness, reducing the cost of the flow to $1$ (because when he receives this signal, he can immediately deduce that other agents have received signals of same evenness, and, assuming others don't deviate, nobody sends the flow through remaining three edges).

### Exercise 62

Consider the following location game:

<img src="../assets/e7_loc.JPG" style="zoom: 15%;" />

An optimal allocation of players is $(l_1, l_4)$. In this case both players are monopolists for corresponding markets and each makes 2 units of cash in profits, so the social surplus is 4.

There is one suboptimal equilibrium allocation: $(l_2, l_3)$. In this case players are still monopolists, but each makes only 1 unit of cash in profits, so the social surplus is 2 (which is exactly half of the optimal). Deviation to other location makes no sense because the deviating player would be forced to lower the price, compensating for the decreased cost.

### Exercise 63

Let's fix a player $i$ and action profile $a = (a_1, \dots, a_i, \dots, a_k)$. Also let $a^\prime = (a_1, \dots, a_i^\prime, \dots, a_k)$. 

From the lecture we know that $\pi_i(a) = V(a) - V(a_{-i})$, where $V(a) = \sum_{j \in M} v_{j} - d_j(a)$. Thinking about it a little bit makes $V$ a perfect candidate for a potential function of the location game:
$$
\pi_i(a^\prime) - \pi_i(a) = V(a^\prime) - V(\underbrace{a_{-i}^\prime}_{=a_{-i}}) - V(a) + V(a_{-i}) = V(a^\prime) - V(a).
$$
So, every location game is a potential game and thus has a Pure Nash Equilibrium.

### Exercise 64

Let $a \in \mathcal A$ be an equilibrium action profile, and $a^* \in \mathcal A$  be an optimal one. Then we have
$$
\forall i \in \mathcal N,\ c_i(a) \le (1 + \epsilon) c_i(a_i^*, a_{-i}).
$$
 Summing this inequality over all players gives us 
$$
C(a) := \sum_{i \in \mathcal N} c_i(a) \le (1 + \epsilon) \sum_{i \in \mathcal N} c_i(a_i^*, a_{-i}). \tag{*}
$$
Now, since game is $(\lambda, \mu)$-smooth, we know that 
$$
\sum_{i \in \mathcal N} c_i(a_i^*, a_{-i}) \le \lambda C(a^*) + \mu C(a).
$$
Substituting it into (*) gives 
$$
\left[1 - (1 + \epsilon) \mu \right] C(a) \le (1 + \epsilon) \lambda C(a^*),
$$
and, since $\epsilon < \frac{1}{\mu} - 1$, 
$$
C(a) \le \frac{(1 + \epsilon) \lambda}{1 - (1 + \epsilon) \mu} C(a^*).
$$
