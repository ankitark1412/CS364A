# Exercise Set III

### Exercise 20

(a) With no reserve price, the revenue in the Vickrey auction with two bidders is just the minimum bid. Its expected value can be computed as the following integral:
$$
\mathbb{E}[p] 
    = 2\int_{0}^{1} \int_{y}^{1} y\ \mathrm{d}x\ \mathrm{d}y 
    = 2\int_{0}^{1} y(1 - y)\ \mathrm{d}y 
    = \left(y^2 - \frac{2y^3}{3}\right) \Bigg|_0^1
    = \frac{1}{3}.
$$
$y$ is the smaller of two bids, it can be in the range from $0$ to $1$, $x$ is the larger of two bids, so it must be in the range from $y$ to $1$. The factor of two is to account that both $v_1$ and $v_2$ can be the smallest bid.

(b) With a reserve price $r > 0$, the revenue is the following:

* 0, if both $v_1$ and $v_2$ are smaller than $r$;
* $r$ if $v_1 < r < v_2$ or $v_2 < r < v_1$ (gives the first integral in the expression below);
* $\min\{v_1, v_2\}$ if both $v_1$ and $v_2$ are larger than $r$ (gives the second integral in the expression below).

Expected value is then
$$
\mathbb{E}[p] 
    = 2 \int_0^r \int_r^1 r\ \mathrm{d}x\ \mathrm{d}y
    + 2 \int_r^1 \int_y^1 y\ \mathrm{d}x\ \mathrm{d}y
    = 2 r^2 (1-r) + 2 \left(\frac{y^2}{2} - \frac{y^3}{3}\right)\Bigg|_r^1
    = \frac{1}{3} + r^2 - \frac{4r^3}{3}.
$$
With $r=\frac{1}{2}$, we get $\mathbb{E}[p] = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{12}$.

### Exercise 21

(a) For the uniform distribution $\mathrm{Unif}(0, a)$, the PDF is $f(v) = \frac{1}{a}$ and the CDF is $F(v) = \frac{v}{a}$, so the virtual valuation function is $\varphi(v) = v - \frac{1 - \frac{v}{a}}{\frac{1}{a}} = 2v - a$.

(b) For the exponential distribution $\mathrm{Exp}(\lambda)$, the PDF is $f(v) = \lambda e^{-\lambda v}$ and the CDF is $F(v) = 1 - e^{-\lambda v}$, so the virtual valuation function is $\varphi(v) = v - \frac{e^{-\lambda v}}{\lambda e^{-\lambda v}} = v - \frac{1}{\lambda}$.

(c) For the distribution with CDF $F(v) = 1 - \frac{1}{(v+1)^c}$, the PDF is $f(v) = \frac{c}{(v+1)^{c+1}}$, so the virtual valuation function is $\varphi(v) = v - \frac{\frac{1}{(v+1)^c}}{\frac{c}{(v+1)^{c+1}}} = v - \frac{1}{c}(v+1) = \frac{c-1}{c}v - \frac{1}{c}$.

In cases (a) and (b), virtual valuation functions are always strictly increasing, while in case (c) it is strictly increasing only for $c > 1$.

### Exercise 22

When $F(v) = 1 - \frac{1}{(v+1)^c}$ with $c = 1$, the virtual valuation function is just a constant: $\varphi(v) = -1$. Obviously, this is not a strictly increasing function, so $F$ is not regular $\Rightarrow$ the allocation rule must not be monotone $\Rightarrow$ the mechanism must not be DSIC $\Rightarrow$ direct revelation principle must not hold $\Rightarrow$ the expected virtual welfare must not be equal to the expected revenue. 

### Exercise 23

An optimal allocation rule is the solution to the problem 
$$
\sum_{j=1}^n \varphi(v_j) \cdot x_j \to \max_{\mathbf{x}} \\
\text{s.t. } \sum_{j=1}^n x_j \le k,\  x_j \in \{0, 1\}
$$
It awards the good to up to $k$ players with highest (positive) virtual valuation. This is, in fact, equivalent to the normal sealed-bid auction with $k$ goods and the reserve price of $\varphi^{-1}(0)$ (which depends only on $F$).

The payment of a winning player $i$ is given by his critical bid, which equals to the difference of (1) the maximum virtual welfare in an auction without $i$ and (2) current virtual welfare of all players except $i$ (see Exercise 15 from the Exercise Set II).

### Exercise 24



### Exercise 25

Essentially, the proof replicates the one for surplus-maximization allocation rule being monotone, but with $\mathbf{\varphi} = \mathbf{\varphi}(\mathbf{b})$ and $\mathbf{\varphi}^\prime = \mathbf{\varphi}(\mathbf{b}^\prime)$ instead of $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{b}^\prime$. 

Recall that $\mathbf{b} = (b_1,\ \dots, b_i,\ \dots b_n)$ and  $\mathbf{b}^\prime = (b_1,\ \dots, b_i^\prime,\ \dots b_n)$ with $b_i < b_i^\prime$. Since all $\varphi_i$'s are regular, $\mathbf{\varphi} = (\varphi_1,\ \dots,\varphi_i,\ \dots, \varphi_n)$ and $\mathbf{\varphi}^\prime = (\varphi_1,\ \dots,\varphi_i^\prime,\ \dots, \varphi_n)$ with $\varphi_i < \varphi_i^\prime$, so we can repeat the reasoning from Exercise 14 (Exercise Set II).

### Exercise 26

(a) Let $i$ be the winner in the optimal auction: $i = \arg \max_j \varphi_j(v_j)$ and $\varphi_i(v_i) > 0$. $i$'s payment equals to the smallest bid at which $i$ still wins the auction. This is either $\varphi_i^{-1}(0)$, if all other players' virtual valuations are below $0$, or $\varphi_i^{-1}(\max_{j \ne i} \varphi_j(v_j))$ otherwise.

(b) Let's imagine we have two bidders, and their valuations are drawn from $\mathrm{Unif}(0, 1)$ and $\mathrm{Unif}(0, 2)$, respectively. So, 
$$
\varphi_1(v) = v - \frac{1 - v}{1} = 2v - 1, \varphi_2(v) = v - \frac{1 - \frac{v}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2v - 2.
$$
If, for example $v_1 = 1$ and $v_2 = \frac{5}{4}$, we get $\varphi_1(v_1) = 1 > \frac{1}{2} = \varphi_2(v_2)$, and the first bidders wins the auction even though he has smaller valuation.

(c) When the good is allocated based on virtual valuations, this increases the chances of the bidders whose valuation distributions have most of the probability mass concentrated in the left part of the support. It effectively increases the competition between the bidders, leading to higher expected revenue for an auctioneer.
